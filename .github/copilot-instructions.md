<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview
DataLab is an agentic data processing application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides AI-powered agents for data analysis, transformation, and visualization.

## Architecture Guidelines
- Use Next.js 15 App Router for file-based routing
- Implement TypeScript strictly with proper type definitions
- Follow React best practices with functional components and hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with a modern, responsive design
- Structure components for reusability and maintainability

## AI Agent Development Guidelines
- Create modular AI agents for specific data processing tasks
- Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Use TypeScript interfaces for agent contracts and data schemas
- Follow async/await patterns for data processing operations
- Implement proper loading states and user feedback

## Data Processing Features
- File upload and parsing (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- Data transformation and cleaning agents
- Statistical analysis and insights generation
- Data visualization with interactive charts
- Export capabilities for processed data

## Code Style
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Implement proper prop types and interfaces
- Follow Next.js best practices for API routes
- Use server components where appropriate for performance
- Implement proper SEO and accessibility features

## Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for utility functions and components
- Test AI agent functionality with mock data
- Implement integration tests for data processing workflows
- Use proper error boundary components
